## Import packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem2

```{r}
homicide <- 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,",",state),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         solved_binary = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(! city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX" ,"Phoenix,AZ","Kansas City,MO","Tulsa,AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White","Black")) %>%
  select(city_state,solved_binary,victim_age,victim_race,victim_sex)
```

```{r}
fit_logistic_homicide = 
  homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>%
  glm(solved_binary ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 
  
```

```{r}
fit_logistic_homicide %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
  
```

```{r}
homicide %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(linear_model = map)
```
